From Wikipedia:
> The Game of Life, also known simply as Conway's Game of Life or simply Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

## Did you know

Many different patterns exist on Game Of Life. `Still lifes`: stays the same, `Oscillators`: cycles periodically, `Spaceships`: travels across the grid. [See more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns).

## Installation

First, [install Bun runtime](https://bun.sh/) because we are using it as a package manager.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Then install dependencies on the root folder:
```bash
bun install
```

Run the dev server. 
```bash
bun run dev
```
